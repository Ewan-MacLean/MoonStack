MoonStack is a great choice! It works well because it:

Suggests being early/first (before the main event)
Has a sophisticated feel
Implies anticipation of something bigger
Is memorable and easy to spell
Has positive musical connotations (building up to something)
Works well for both app store listing and domain name
Could inspire nice visual branding (musical notes, rising charts, etc.)
